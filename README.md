The Magical Input Controller

Greetings, brave mage of code! The Magical Input Controller is an enchanted script designed to summon and manage player input in Godot 4.0+. Think of it as a spellbook that listens to your keyboard keys, mouse clicks, and even arcane gamepad buttons, all without separate incantations. You can easily rebind your ‚Äúspells‚Äù (input actions) at runtime to any key or button, so if your wizardly hand grows tired, feel free to switch it up! This library is fully Godot 4 compatible (we recommend using the latest stable release
github.com
) and ties into Godot‚Äôs own InputMap system so that your code reads like casting spells, not writing boilerplate
